# fundMeSmartContract
This is my first web3 project. This contract allows users to fund it with Ether. The contract keeps track of how much each user has funded. The contract owner can then withdraw all the funds. Additionally, the contract integrates with the Chainlink Price Feed to ensure users fund the contract with a minimum amount in terms of USD value.
